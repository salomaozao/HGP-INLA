TODO: 
    Pegar caso da zaida e literalmente jogar pro nosso modelo
    Fazer simulação para o caso de grid OK
        O que tá errado nesse código caralho
        
    

caso poisson está ok, logo modelo está ok

(?):
- RMSP is the root mean squared error of prediction
- CPP is the frequentist coverage of the 95% prediction interval
- Width is the width of the prediction interval
-  IS is the interval score.

Several R packages contain procedures for simulation (and conditional simulation) of Gaussian spatial processes, including Spatial and geoRglm. You need to supply a variogram model for the spatial autocorrelation (and both of these contain procedures to help estimate such a model from data)
also check out the RandomFields package, which has a very complete set of Gaussian simulation methods
